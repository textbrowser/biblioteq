196. Users should only be allowed to view their reservation histories.
     Create temporary views? No. Row-level privacy.
197. After an item has been added, the item's row must be updated. One
     issue with this requirement is that the item may not be listed
     in the main table. Thus, its row number will not be available.
     Item rows are updated on data retrieval. If an item is updated,
     its table / view representation is changed if the representation has
     the same OID as the item.
198. Bind values in SQL queries:

313. Status-bar label widgets and system icons. Consider states.
314. System icons:
	Edit
	Help
	Items
	Mainwindow
	Mainwindow Status Bar
	Options
	Tools
	View
315. Replace QString(tr()) with tr().
316. Type (Title) for tabbed items. If not available, windowTitle().
317. MacOS: inspect the Homebrew libpq path and display a reminder
     if the path does not refer to the newest version.
318. Remove duplicate mnemonics.
319. Page-selection menu in main window.
320. "edit: editing failed" and Locations table in Database Enumerations
     Browser. The warning appears during a tab-key transition from an
     editable QTableWidgetItem to a cell which houses an editable QWidget.
321. Set new tab title if an item's title is revised.
322. Include time in item-request date.
323. Select the appropriate member during a reservation process.
     (All Requested -> Home -> Members Browser)
324. Provide a reminder if an item has been returned which is also
     requested (biblioteq::slotRequest()).
325. Apple Silicon and biblioteq.macos.pro: BIBLIOTEQ_MACOS_LIBPQ_PATH.
326. Review QApplication::topLevelWidgets() and tabbed item windows.
327. Attempt to duplicate return-reminders for SQLite. Much work.
328. Cell colors and custom queries. Must be rapid!
329. Enumerate database fields and table columns:
	biblioteq_batch_activities_browser
	biblioteq_book
	biblioteq_cd
	biblioteq_copy_editor_book
	biblioteq_dbenumerations
330. Maybe icons on tabs of paged items.

Remaining

1.   Query Open Library for journals / magazines cover images.
2.   Qt 6 statistics.
3.   Special Unimarc import.
4.   Preserve order of columns in the main table. Nearly impossible.
5.   Create unique myoid values on SQLite merge.
6.   Copy editor item status database table.
7.   Test Android and correct.
8.   PostgreSQL notifications: PostgreSQL::notify() and
     QSqlDriver::subscribeToNotification().
9.   Allow a photograph to be moved to another set via a new panel.
